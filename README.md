# Cliker-Game
A clicker game I'm making in C# as a WPF app. The code here is not final, it's just an example/concept. The entire thing is a hard coded mess as of right now.

1) Classic clicker -- 
There is a big button on the screen that when clicked adds 1 click to the clicks counter above.
2) Achievements -- 
The clicks from the classic gamemode are tracked and are shown across progress bars how many clicks you need to gain the next achievement. Currently a bit scuffed.
3) Settings -- 
Pay no attention to the settings page, it is just a concept. Here you would be able to change the backrgound music and the click sound volumes if they were added already. In the future, you will be able to change the classic button's theme. Themes will be earned through achievements.
4) Precision clicker -- 
This one is like the settings, not yet implemented, but will be a game mode where instead of a big button, you will see a small one that moves across the screen and with every couple clicks will speed up.

I might add achievements for the precision gamemode in the future as well as a new game mode called reflex where small buttons will appear one after the other and will be visible for a short and limited time.

Ps. Page1 is the achievements page, Page2 is the settings page.
